The late Steve Jobs said in an interview that “everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer because it teaches you how to think”. Truer words have never been spoken and, whether you are looking to learn to program for fun or whether you want to improve your skill set and job prospects, you can do no better than to learn how to program.

Computer programming is one of the most flexible tools that you can have at your disposal. Not only can you learn to do things that are pretty amazing, but you can also, sometimes, manage to perform the impossible. Anyone that uses a computer, a smartphone, even a key that remotely unlocks your car door is using some form of computer programming and your life already depends on programming to a certain extent. For the vast majority of people in today’s digital world, their lives are already being run and ruled by software so why not learn to program and get involved, create your own programs to do what you want them to do?

For example, what if you receive tons of text messages daily on your smartphone and just didn’t have time to respond to them all? You could create a program that did it for you, sending an automatic response without you even needing to see the messages. You could program specific messages for specific contacts; you could actually do pretty much what you wanted.

But don’t make the mistake of thinking that learning how to program will put you in the position of building the next big social media app or the next file sharing app. Go back in time a little and look at the big websites; YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox etc. They came into being because someone identified a need, a gap in the market that needed to be filled. Just because you learn to program it doesn’t mean that you need to solve all the problems in the world. What you can do is learn how to solve your own problems. Here are ten of the very best reasons why you should learn to program today.
