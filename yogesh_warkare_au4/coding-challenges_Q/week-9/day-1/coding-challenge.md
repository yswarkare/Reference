# Search - Server Side

Create a Javascript application that lets the user search for books under a particular language - 

![book library](book-library.png)

Create a NodeJS script to search data from this JSON object [data.json](data.json).

Search the books in the Express routes and render the data using Handlebars.

Note: 
1. No `Ajax` is needed
2. No `POST` route is needed

Hint:
`GET` route to retrieve all the books should also support book search with a `search query`
