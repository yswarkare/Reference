## Create a Quiz application in jQuery

![quiz](../../../images/quiz.png)

Scope of Work (Requirements):
1. The application should load a random question from the [quiz.json](quiz.json) file. Hint - You can use `var randomNumber = Math.floor( Math.random() * 10 )` to get a random number which can be used as an index for the question array.
2. Once the user types an answer in the textbox and clicks Submit, the app should check whether the answer is correct or not. Show a dialog window (prompt) depening up on the right/wrong answer.
3. Also, once the page is loaded, a timer should be started from 30 seconds and go down till 0 second. Once the timer reaches 0, the user should be shown a message saying that `Time is over!` and he/she should not be able to submit an answer after that.
4. For styling and layout, please use Bootstrap.
