#### Create a REST API calculator using ExpressJS
1. Create four routes in Express for add, sub, mul and div.
2. Each route should take two POST data parameters - `num1` and `num2` in JSON format and do the arithmetic operation on them.
3. Example output: For sum, the response should look like - 
```
{
    "num1": 20
    "num2": 50,
    "result": 70
}
```
4. No need for UI. Everything can be tested using Postman or Insomnia.
