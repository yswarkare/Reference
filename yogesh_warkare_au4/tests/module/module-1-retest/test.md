# Module 1 - Re-Test
1. Create an express app
2. Setup MongoDB connection 
3. Create routes with GET, POST, PUT, DELETE HTTP methods ONLY on `/employees` route to retrieve or add or manipulate or delete data (use placeholders wherever required)
	- **GET** `/employees ` should retrieve all employees
	- **GET** `/employees/:id` should retrieve a specific employee
4. Create UI in handlebars 
5. Use Bootstrap for styling

Note:
1. UI for creating an employee is mandatory 
2.  Add node_modules directory to .gitignore file before commiting (VERY IMPORTANT)
3.  Commit every 45-40 minutes because just in case you lose the file or anything bad happens -- you can have some saved data
4. Create a file `honor-of-code.txt` and paste the below content in it. Please make sure you read the same before pasting it.

*I will not give or receive aid in examinations; I will not give or receive unpermitted aid in class work, in the preparation of reports, or in any other work that is to be used by the instructor as the basis of grading;*

*I will do my share and take an active part in seeing to it that others as well as themselves uphold the spirit and letter of the Honor Code.*
