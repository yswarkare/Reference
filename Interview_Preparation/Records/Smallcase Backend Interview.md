	I have worked on a project of creating a website for ratings and reviews of various kinds of products that one could buy online or use in daily life. I always check ratings and reviews of any product on different-different platforms before purchasing it, besides price, and I have always liked the ratings and reviews system of flipkart than any other online shopping website. I wanted to try to create something like it.
